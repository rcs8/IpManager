Feature: Preenchimento de notas
As a Teacher/Assistant
I want to be able to register student�s evaluations and calculate their average grade
So That I can verify if the student has reached the minimum grade to pass

Scenario: Calculate Average with all grades (GUI)
Given I am at the grades page
And I can see  the student �Rodrigo Cunha� in the list
And I have the lists �Lista 1�, �Lista 2�, �Lista 3�, �Lista 4�, �Lista 5�, �Lista 6�
And I have the tests �Prova 1�, �Prova 2�, �Prova 3�
And I have the �Mini-projeto�
And the grades for these evaluations are �10�, �8�, �9�, �10� �5�, �9� for the lists, �6�,�8�,�10� for the tests, �9� for the project
When I submit the average for the student �Rodrigo Cunha� using a weighted average and weights �2�,�7� and �1�� for lists, tests and project respectively
Then the average for �Rodrigo Cunha� is �8,2� with status �Aprovado�
And I can see a confirmation message
